# Roblox-AvatarGroundAlignment
AvatarGroundAlignment is a utility script for Roblox that automatically aligns any player avatar (R6 or R15) so that its feet rest perfectly on the ground, regardless of avatar size, body scaling, or HumanoidRootPart position.

The script includes detailed comments to make it easy to read and learn from.
